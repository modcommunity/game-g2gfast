"""Read a Source VBSP (v19/v20) far enough to get geometry and zones out of it.

Point it at a surf or bhop map in the genre's usual format and it writes an .obj of the
world geometry and a .json of the entities that become timer zones and spawns.

    tools/bsp_read.py ../inspirations/g2gfast/surf_kitsune.bsp out/

Why this is only a reader and not an importer: what a *map* is here is a
`G2GMap` subclass with `_build()` and `timer_zones()` (see maps/surf_g2g_intro.gd),
and the interesting decisions -- which volume is the START, which of thirty
materials is a ramp, what a stage is -- are judgement calls that differ per map.
Those belong in a hand-written map script that reads this output, not in a
converter guessing at them.

[b]Units.[/b] Source stores map coordinates in the same units this game is
authored in -- `G2GUnits.METRES_PER_UNIT` is 0.01905, which is the Source ratio of
0.75 inch per unit -- so nothing is scaled here. Only the axes are swapped, because
Source is Z-up and Godot is Y-up:

    godot = (src.x, src.z, -src.y)

Emitting metres instead would be the obvious alternative and is wrong: every other
number in this project (`fallback_spawn_units`, `zone_box`, every tunable) is in
genre units, and a map file that mixed the two is a map file nobody can read.
Multiply by `G2GUnits.METRES_PER_UNIT` at the same single boundary everything else
does.
