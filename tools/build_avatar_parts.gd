## Generates the avatar part scenes from Kenney's Blocky Characters.

## [codeblock]
## godot --headless --path . --script tools/build_avatar_parts.gd
## [/codeblock]
##
## Writes `avatars/body_kenney_<x>.tscn` and `avatars/head_kenney_<x>.tscn`, one pair
## per character, from `avatars/kenney/character-<x>.glb`.
##
## [b]Generated rather than authored, because the 18 characters are one mesh set.[/b]
## Every GLB in that kit carries byte-identical geometry — leg-left, leg-right, torso,
## arm-left, arm-right, head — and differs only by the atlas it samples. Hand-building
## 36 scenes that differ by one texture reference is 36 chances to get one wrong, and
## the kit gaining a nineteenth character would mean noticing.
##
## The split is by slot, not by file: a "body" is everything except the head, because
## [G2GAvatars] has a head slot and a player who picks a different head must not get
## two.
##
## [b]Two corrections a straight export does not make, and both are invisible in the
## file.[/b] A Kenney character is 2.7 m tall and this genre's player hull is 72 units,
## which is 1.372 m -- so an imported character is very nearly TWICE the size of the
## thing it represents, standing with its head above the camera and its shoulders
## through every doorway, with every property of every node correct. And the parts are
## authored in the character's own space (feet at 0, head at 1.9) while [G2GRig] mounts
## each slot at a point and expects the part to be centred on it, the way the capsule
## primitives that came first are. Both are applied here rather than asked of the rig,
## because the rig is right and the art is what has to fit it.
