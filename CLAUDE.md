# game-g2gfast

A bunny-hop and surf timer game in the competitive-shooter shape: the genre's
movement, its units, its cvars, a timer with zones an admin draws from the console, first and
third person, and every player drawn as an avatar.

Read the family-wide conventions in [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) first, and
each addon's own `CLAUDE.md` before working in it. This file is only about what this
game decides.

## What this game is, versus game-playground

game-playground is a sandbox that happens to have a surf ramp. This is the *timer
server*: the thing one of those communities would actually migrate to. Everything it
adds over the addons is one of four decisions, and the decisions are the file.

## Layout

## Decision 1: everything the operator touches is in genre units

`sv_airaccelerate 1000`, `sv_gravity 800`, a run speed of 250 u/s, a surf ramp that is
"1024 wide at 60°". A bhop server operator knows what those mean and nobody knows what
19.05 m/s² is. So every cvar, every config field, every HUD number and every map file
speaks genre units, and **the conversion to the metres the simulation runs in happens
at exactly one boundary — `G2GMovement.tunables_for`** — with `G2GUnits` as the only
definition of the ratio. A conversion anywhere else is a second copy of the ratio, and
two copies drift.

The ratio is **1 unit = 0.01905 m** (0.75 inch), the scale the genre's maps were
built at, not the 1-inch
figure sometimes quoted. It is what the 72-unit hull, the 64-unit eye and every map in
the genre were built against; at the wrong scale a surf ramp is one the movement cannot
hold.

The jump is specified as a **launch velocity** (301.99 u/s) and converted to the height
the tunables want with `h = v²/2g` — 57 units under 800, the number every bhop player
knows — so it stays honest when an operator changes `sv_gravity`.

## Decision 2: auto-bhop is the server's, and the styles defer to it

`sv_autobunnyhopping` (`G2GConfig.auto_bhop`) is the setting this game exists to expose.
It reaches every player through `G2GGame.apply_movement`, which rebuilds the tunables
and hands them to everybody — **abandoning every run in progress**, because a run half on
one movement and half on another is a run on neither. Same rule as a tick-rate change.

**The shipped `DotFpsStyle.defaults()` force auto-hop ON**, which is right for a game
with no cvar and wrong here. The first version left them as shipped and
`sv_autobunnyhopping 0` reached every player's tunables and was then undone by the
style on top — silently. `_build_styles` now sets every style's `auto_hop` and
`easy_bhop` to `INHERIT`, except `prebhop`, whose whole identity is "no auto-hop".

**A movement cvar is validated before the config is written**, through the console's
own validator on a *copy* of the config. The first version wrote the field, validated,
and on failure returned — leaving the config invalid, after which every later cvar
wrote its field, found the config still invalid because of the first, and quietly did
nothing while the console reported them all as set.

### A thing that looked like a bug and is the genre's physics being faithful

A player holding jump from a standstill creeps at exactly 30 u/s — the air cap — for
ever. On the tick a jump fires the player is already airborne when acceleration runs,
so a held key never gets a ground-acceleration tick. Those games do precisely this
(`CheckJumpButton` runs before `WalkMove`), which is why every real bhop run begins with
a **prestrafe**. The headless suite's bot walks before it hops; an hour was spent
finding out why it had to.

## Decision 3: the genre's field of view, not Godot's

`fov_desired 90` is 90° **horizontal at 4:3**, and those games widen it on a wider
screen.
Godot's `Camera3D.fov` is vertical and fixed. `G2GUnits.source_fov_to_vertical`
converts through the 4:3 frame: 90 becomes 73.74° vertical, which on 16:9 shows 106.26°
horizontally — exactly what they show. Handing 90 straight to Godot gives 121° at
16:9 and a player who cannot aim and cannot say why. Tested to the hundredth of a
degree, with the naive number named so it stays a mistake.

`sensitivity` has its usual meaning too: degrees per count is `sensitivity × 0.022`, so a
player's 2.5 works unchanged.

**Third person is cosmetic.** `G2GCamera` keeps both cameras and flips `current`; the
first-person one culls the local rig's render layer so the player does not see the
inside of their own head, the third-person one sits on a `SpringArm3D` and draws
everything. The controller aims from the eye whichever is active.
`sv_allow_thirdperson 0` is server-side because third person sees over ledges first
person cannot, and it puts anybody already in it back.

## Decision 4: one avatar schema, two sources of parts

`G2GAvatars.schema()` is a real `DotAvatarSchema` — body, head, hat — and the rig has one
attachment node per slot. **A stock character and a player's own avatar from the
platform are the same thing at different addresses**: the six stock parts ship in the
build under `res://avatars/`, a platform part names dot-cloud content, and
`DotAvatarBuilder` does not care which it got. A player with no avatar gets
`stock_avatar(id)`, a real document over the same schema, deterministic in the id so the
same player is the same colour on every machine.

`DotAvatarSchema.conform()` **edits the document in place** and returns what it changed.
`G2GAvatars.apply` runs it on a copy, or a server that could not draw one part would
quietly rewrite a player's own avatar. A part from a newer client is dropped, never
refused: a player is never invisible because their hat is from the future.

## Validating

```bash
godot --headless --path . --import
godot --headless --path . --script tools/export_zones.gd
godot --headless --path . res://examples/headless_run.tscn   # 91 checks
godot --headless --path . res://examples/headless_net.tscn   # 76 checks
godot --headless --path . res://examples/dedicated.tscn      # 52 checks
```

**Two checks in `headless_run` were measuring the wrong thing and only stopped when
dot-timer was fixed.** `DotTimer.effect_requested` was emitted by nothing, so this
game's maps had respawn zones that did nothing and a bot that missed the ramps fell out
of the level and kept falling. "Most of the descent is spent not grounded, which is
surf" was counting 1500 ticks of a bot nowhere near the map, and passed comfortably.
The bot is now put back on the start platform after about 500 ticks; the loop stops
there, is airborne for 94% of them, and the suite asserts the pit fired at all. The
bhop test's fixed 420-tick prestrafe had the same problem and now drives until the run
starts.


`headless_net` runs a server game and a client game in one process over a lossy
loopback: admission, prediction converging, the timer and a finish replicated to the
sub-tick fraction, a cvar changed under a live client, styles, tracks, a published
avatar, a map change, a bot, and leaving.

`dedicated` configures the server for **100** ticks in `server.cfg` — deliberately not
the project's 128 — and checks the game and the timer count at 100, because a test
using the same number at both ends would pass with the chain disconnected.

## Decision 5: the movement configuration travels, not the tunables

`G2GNetBridge` sends a joining client the server's `G2GConfig` movement fields
(`G2GConfig.MOVEMENT_FIELDS`) and both ends derive `DotFpsTunables` through the same
`G2GMovement.tunables_for`. The alternative — sending the tunables — is one more
representation that can drift, and prediction only converges when the two ends
simulate with identical numbers. The server fingerprints what it derived and the
client compares; a mismatch is one log line rather than "the netcode feels bad".

That is also why `G2GConfig.snap_movement()` exists and why `G2GGame` calls it before
deriving anything: the wire carries float32, and a server simulating with the doubles
it read from a file while its clients simulate with what they received differs in the
last bit, silently. The values are rounded once, on the server, before anything reads
them.

The bridge is modelled on dot-2d-hungry's, the one in this family proven over a real
socket. What is specific to this game:

- **The tick is a whole-game property.** dot-net simulates per entity; here everybody
  moves and then every timer is fed the position its move produced. The first
  behaviour through on a tick runs the whole game (`ensure_game_ticked`); the rest find
  it done. The client's `client_tick` does the same for what it predicts and then feeds
  every timer, so a remote player's clock on your HUD advances with theirs.
- **Timers replicate as run identities, not per tick.** `DotTimerNet.RunState` carries
  the start tick and the sub-tick fractions; the client's clock does the counting
  between packets. A finish carries ticks and fractions, and the client reproduces the
  server's arithmetic to the digit — `headless_net` compares them at 1e-4 s, which is
  how it found `DotTimerNet.Finish.time()` subtracting the end fraction the run adds.
- **A peer receives nothing until it says READY.** dot-server's signon finishes and
  *then* the client builds its scene; a HELLO sent in between lands on nothing.
- **Bots are session ids without a peer.** Peer 0 is dot-net's broadcast address, so
  a bot is never a peer; `remove_player` handles both, `remove_peer` delegates.
- **A player's avatar comes from dot-platform's admission** (`G2GModule._avatar_for`,
  duck-typed through the `platform` module) and, failing that, from what the client
  publishes (`G2GClient.avatar`), and failing that the stock one. Every one goes
  through `G2GRig.dress`, which conforms it to the server's schema.

## Decision 6: the record's ghost is a player

The replay bot every community timer has: the server record's replay runs the map
as a `G2GPlayer`
with `replay` set and no timer. That one choice does three jobs. It draws through the
same rig everybody else does; it replicates through the same bridge, so a client —
browser included — sees the run without ever decoding a replay; and it counts as a
bot in the server query, which is what it is.

`sv_replay_bot` turns it on and off live, and off takes the current ghost away rather
than waiting for the next map — an operator who turns a bot off wants it gone now.
`g2g_ghost` says whose record is running and how far through it is.

`G2GReplays` keeps the fastest replay per map, track and style, in memory always and
on disk beside the records when there is a directory, using `DotTimerReplay`'s own
file format — so a replay set at 64 Hz plays on a 128 Hz server. **A replay is kept
only with an accepted record**, never with a merely faster run: a checkpoint-assisted
or tainted run is not a record and must not become the ghost everybody chases.

The bridge adopts any player the game made itself (`player_added`) as an entity with
no peer, and `ensure_game_ticked` applies received commands **only to players that
have a peer** — a bot is driven by something else, and an empty command applied on
top of a replay stands the ghost still. That rule was found by `dedicated`, whose
driven bots stopped hopping the moment the bridge started adopting them.

`!r`, `!wr`, `!top`, `!style`, `!track`, `!rtv` are chat triggers as well as console
commands, because twenty years of bhop servers taught everybody's fingers those.
`g2g_map` is not: changing the map from chat is an admin's, through the console.

## Things deliberately not here

- **A second transport.** The bridge speaks through `DotClientLink`'s RPCs on one
  `MultiplayerAPI`; browser and desktop clients on one server is the family-wide gap
  in PLATFORM.md.
- **Props.** This is the timer server. game-playground has the sandbox.
- **Real maps.** These two are fixtures that happen to be playable, built in units so a
  mapper can read them.
